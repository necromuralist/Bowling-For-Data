These are the properties that need to be maintained for a Red-Black Tree to work correctly (from {{% lancelot "CLRS" %}}clrs{{% /lancelot %}}).

1. Every Node is either **Red** or **Black**.
2. The Root is **Black**.
3. Every Leaf (Nil) is **Black**.
4. If a Node is **Red** then both of its children are **Black**.
5. For each Node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of **Black** Nodes.

When the properties are true the height of a tree with *n* nodes is \(O(\log(n))\).
