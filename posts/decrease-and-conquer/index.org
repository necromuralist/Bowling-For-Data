With /Decrease-and-Conquer/ algorithms you exploit the relationship between the solution to a problem and the solution to a sub-problem. There are three types of Decrease-and-Conquer algorithms:

 - Decrease by a constant (typically one)
 - Decrease by a constant factor (typically two)
 - Decrease by a variable amount
