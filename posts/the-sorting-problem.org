* English(ish)
  The sorting problem involves taking a list of things that can be compared to each other to decide their order and then sorting them into ascending order (actually non-decreasing, since you can have multiple items with the same value, but, this was supposed to be the plain-English version).
* Specification
  - *Preconditions:* The input is a list of /n/ orderable items, possibly with repetitions.
  - *Postconditions:* The output is a list of the same /n/ items in non-decreasing order.
