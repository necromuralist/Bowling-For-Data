* Description
The Divide-and-Conquer approach involves three parts.

- **Divide:** Break the problem up into sub-problems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
- **Conquer:** If the problem is small enough solve it, otherwise recursively solve the sub-problem.
- **Combine:** Combine the solutions to the sub-problems into a solution for the original problem.
